Introduction - 
This project seeks to implement a game inspired by the Atari-2600 game “Bank Heist” in the C programming language, displaying the game via Command Line Interface(CLI). You as the player are the robber and you have to rob banks in a city. Each bank robbery alerts a cop who seeks to catch you. You have four lives during the game. You also have access to bombs which can damage the walls of the city maze and kill cops. After clearing all the banks in the city, you can cross the boundary and go to a new city to plunder.

The program objectives are as follows - 
To let user enjoy a lightweight version of the game ported to the C programming language

Prerequisites and installation instructions - 
Prerequisites are -
Ensure that you hav MSYS2 64 bit version as there are dependancies inside the code for this (namely pthreads)

run the following command in the directory that you have unzipped the files into - 

gcc -o B23EE1079_B23EE1030_B23PH1013_B23CH1004_main.c B23EE1079_B23EE1030_B23PH1013_B23CH1004_major
.\B23EE1079_B23EE1030_B23PH1013_B23CH1004_major

Or if you do not wish to use the command line directly, simply open the code in the IDE of choice and run it.
